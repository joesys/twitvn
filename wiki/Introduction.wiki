TwitVN - the coolest damned script a sysad will ever install

= Details =

So in essence I wrote this because I felt like it!

It exists to let dev departments be stressed on by management. Though I can imagine an alternative universe where the opposite actually happens. 

= Are you ever going to spit it out...? =

yes.

TwitVN lets you publish your SVN commits to a twitter feed and include a trac link with it. Why? Basically so that you can have fun with your SVN traffic. You *could* have it all sent into your mail - but why? Why clutter your mail box? Send it to twitter - let them aggregate the RSS for you and put it in your managers favourite browser or rss reader, etc.

Hmm.. sounded like a good idea at the time :)
